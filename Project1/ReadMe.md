This project concerns probability distributions and bayesian network construction.

# Finding the Mean, variance and standard distribution for each variable in university data.xlsx.
# For each pair of variables, covariance and correlation is calculated and is plotted.
# The Log-likelihood of data is determined assuming that each variable is normally distributed and that they are independent of each other.
# Bayesian network is constructed based on these correlation values. It resuted in higher log-likelihood than that in the previous step
